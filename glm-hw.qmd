**Data:** Use this mortality dataset to answer the questions below. [`mortality.csv`](mortality.csv)

1. Using the `glm` function, run a multiple regression with IQ to predict and mortality status. Past studies have found that higher levels of IQ are associated with longer life.

2. Then run the same function using the `lm` function. What are the similarities, what are the differences between these two approaches? Look at both the `anova` and the `summary` outputs. 

3. Plot the data with `ggplot2`. Fit a linear best fit line and a logistic curve (the S shape). You will need to google how to do the latter, but here's a hint: it's very similar to what you know, but you need to change some arguments! Make sure each line is a different color to make it easier to see.

4. Now control for risky behavior using the most appropriate model (is it linear model or the generalized linear model?). Interpret all of the coefficients to the best of your ability.

5. Instead of using a logit link function, rerun the analysis in #4 using a probit link function. What differences do you notice?
