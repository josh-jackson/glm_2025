    "text": "Can a team have too much talent?\nResearchers hypothesized that teams with too many talented players have poor intra-team coordination and perform worse than teams with a moderate amount of talent. They looked at 208 international football teams. Talent was the percentage of players during the 2010 and 2014 World Cup Qualifications phases who also had contracts with elite club teams. Performance was the number of points the team earned during these same qualification phases.\nSwaab, R.I., Schaerer, M, Anicich, E.M., Ronay, R., and Galinsky, A.D. (2014). [The too-much-talent effect: Team interdependence determines when more talent is too much or not enough.](https://www8.gsb.columbia.edu/cbs-directory/sites/cbs-directory/files/publications/Too%20much%20talent%20PS.pdf Psychological Science 25(8), 1581-1591."
